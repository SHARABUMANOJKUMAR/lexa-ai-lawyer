    <title>LeXa AI Lawyer</title>
    <meta name="description" content="LeXa AI Lawyer – Smart Judiciary of India is a production-ready, AI-powered legal assistance platform designed for real-world use in India. Built as a true multi-agent system, it aligns with the Indian Constitution, IPC/BNS, and CrPC to support citizens, lawyers, and administrators—without replacing courts, police, or judges.

The platform offers an AI Legal Chat with judiciary-grade language, working file and evidence uploads, and clear, structured explanations. Users can file cases through a realistic FIR-style intake process, generate and download court-ready FIRs and legal drafts, and understand legal risks using AI confidence indicators and explainable reasoning.

It includes fully functional Citizen, Lawyer, and Admin dashboards, system analytics, ethics controls, and secure workflows. The UI follows a futuristic Indian High Court theme, is mobile-responsive, and delivers a trustworthy, transparent, and society-ready digital justice experience.">
